## Installation

[PHP](https://php.net) 5.5+ or [HHVM](http://hhvm.com) 3.6+, a database server, and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) are required.

1. From a command line open in the folder, run `composer install --no-dev -o` and then `npm install`.
2. Enter your database details into `config/database.php`.
3. Run `php artisan app:install` followed by `gulp --production` to setup the application.
4. You will need to enter your mail server details into `config/mail.php`.
  * You can disable verification emails in `config/credentials.php`
  * Mail is still required for other functions like password resets and the contact form
  * You must set the contact email in `config/contact.php`
  * I'd recommend [queuing](#setting-up-queing) email sending for greater performance (see below)
5. Finally, setup an [Apache VirtualHost](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/vhosts/examples.html) to point to the "public" folder.
  * For development, you can simply run `php artisan serve`


## Setting Up Queuing

1. Check out Laravel's [documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/master/queues#configuration).
2. Enter your queue server details into `config/queue.php`.


## Setting Up Caching

1. Choose your poison - I'd recommend [Redis](http://redis.io).
2. Enter your cache server details into `config/cache.php`.
3. Setting the driver to array will effectively disable caching if you don't want the overhead.


## Setting Up Themes

1. You can set your theme in `config/theme.php`.
2. You can also set your navbar style in `config/theme.php`.
3. After making theme changes, you will have to run `php artisan app:update`.


## Setting Up Google Analytics

1. Setup a web property on [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics).
2. Enter your tracking id into `config/analytics.php`.
3. Enable Google Analytics in `config/analytics.php`.


## Setting Up CloudFlare Analytics

1. Follow the install instructions for [Laravel CloudFlare](https://github.com/BootstrapCMS/CloudFlare) package.
2. Bootstrap CMS will auto-detect the package, only allow admin access, and add links to the navigation bar.
